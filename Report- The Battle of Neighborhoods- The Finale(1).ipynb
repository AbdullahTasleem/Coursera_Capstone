Introduction\n\nEuropean Countries are quite famous and popular vacation destinations for people all around the world. London, the city of dreams and Paris, the city of love are quite the famous places. They are diverse and multicultural and offer a wide variety of experiences that is widely sought after. We try to group the neighbourhoods of London and Paris respectively and draw insights to what they look like.\n\n\n# 2. Business Problem\n\nThe aim of the project is to help tourists choose their destinations depending on the experiences that the neighbourhoods have to offer and what they would want to have. This also helps people make decisions if they are thinking about migrating to London or Paris or even if they want to relocate neighbourhoods within the city. Relocating requires intensive research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. Our findings will help stakeholders make informed decisions and address any concerns they have including the different kinds of cuisines, provision stores and what the city has to offer. It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for vacation, their work or to start a new fresh life.\n\n\n# 3. Data\n\nWe get geolocation data for London and Paris. Using Postal codes in each city we use can find out the neighbourhoods, boroughs, venues and their most popular venue categories. For London, we will scrape our data from a Wikipedia page. For Paris, we will import the dataset available online.\n\n\n## 3.1. Foursquare API\n\nWe will need data about different venues in different neighbourhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\nWe cluster the neighbourhoods together based on similar venue categories. We then present our observations and findings. Using this data, our stakeholders can take the necessary decision.\n\n## 3.2. ArcGis API\n\nWe use ArcGIS to get the geo locations of the neighbourhoods of London.\n\n## 3.3. Paris\nTo derive our solution, We leverage JSON data available at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/e88c6fda-1d09-42a0-a069-606d3259114e\n\n# 4. Methodology\nWe will start by importing some of the Python libraries that we need for this project"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.cm as cm\nimport matplotlib.colors as colors\nimport folium\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans", "execution_count": 1, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The approach taken here is to explore each of the cities individually, plot the map to show the neighbourhoods being considered and then build our model by clustering all of the similar neighbourhoods together and finally plot the new map with the clustered neighbourhoods. We draw insights and then compare and discuss our findings.\n\n\n\n## 4.1. Data Collection\n\nIn the data collection stage, we begin with collecting the required data for the cities of London and Paris. We need data that has the postal codes, neighbourhoods and boroughs specific to each of the cities.\n\nTo collect data for Paris, we download the JSON file containg all the postal codes of France from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/e88c6fda-1d09-42a0-a069-606d3259114e\nUsing Pandas we load the table after reading the JSON file.\n\n\n## 4.2. Data Preprocessing\n\nFor London, We replace the spaces with underscores in the title.The borough column has numbers within square brackets that we remove.\n\n\n## 4.3. Feature Selection\n\nFor both of our datasets, we need only the borough, neighbourhood, postal codes and geolocations (latitude and longitude). So we end up selecting the columns that we need.\n\n## 4.4. Feature Engineering\nBoth of our Datasets actually contain information related to all the cities in the country. We can narrow down and further process the data by selecting only the neighbourhoods pertaining to 'London' and 'Paris'.\n\n## 4.5. Visualizing the Neighbourhoods of London and Paris\n\nNow that our datasets are ready, using the Folium package, we can visualize the maps of London and Paris with the neighbourhoods that we collected.\n\n### Map of the Neighbourhoods of London\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AbdullahTasleem/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-13%20at%209.47.55%20PM.png\">\n\n### Map of the Neighbourhoods of Paris\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AbdullahTasleem/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-13%20at%209.49.04%20PM.png\">\n\n# 4.6. One Hot Encoding\n\nSince we are trying to find out what are the different kinds of venue categories present in each neighbourhood and then calculate the top 10 common venues to base our similarity on, we use the One Hot Encoding to work with our categorical datatype of the venue categories. This helps to convert the categorical data into numeric data.\nWe won't be using label encoding in this situation since label encoding might cause our machine learning model to have a bias or a sort of ranking which we are trying to avoid by using One Hot Encoding.\nWe perform one hot encoding and then calculate the mean of the grouped venue categories for each of the neighbourhoods.\n\n# 4.7. Model Building - KMeans\n\nMoving on to the most exicitng part - Model Building! We will be using KMeans Clustering Machine learning algorithm to cluster similar neighbourhoods together. We will be going with the number of clusters as 5.\n\n# 5. Results and Discussion\n\nThe neighbourhoods of London are very mulitcultural. There are a lot of different cusines including Indian, Italian, Turkish and Chinese. London seems to take a step further in this direction by having a lot of Restaurants, bars, juice bars, coffee shops, Fish and Chips shop and Breakfast spots. It has a lot of shopping options too with that of the Flea markets, flower shops, fish markets, Fishing stores, clothing stores. The main modes of transport seem to be Buses and trains. For leisure, the neighbourhoods are set up to have lots of parks, golf courses, zoo, gyms and Historic sites. Overall, the city of London offers a multicultural, diverse and certainly an entertaining experience.\nParis is relatively small in size geographically. It has a wide variety of cusines and eateries including French, Thai, Cambodian, Asian, Chinese etc. There are a lot of hangout spots including many Restaurants and Bars. Paris has a lot of Bistro's. Different means of public transport in Paris which includes buses, bikes, boats or ferries. For leisure and sight seeing, there are a lot of Plazas, Trails, Parks, Historic sites, clothing shops, Art galleries and Museums. Overall, Paris seems like the relaxing vacation spot with a mix of lakes, historic spots and a wide variety of cusines to try out.\n\n# 6. Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this project was to explore the cities of London and Paris and see how attractive it is to potential tourists and migrants. We explored both the cities based on their postal codes and then extrapolated the common venues present in each of the neighbourhoods finally concluding with clustering similar neighbourhoods together.\nWe could see that each of the neighbourhoods in both the cities have a wide variety of experiences to offer which is unique in it's own way. The cultural diversity is quite evident which also gives the feeling of a sense of inclusion.\nBoth Paris and London seem to offer a vacation stay or a romantic getaway with a lot of places to explore, beautiful landscapes, amazing food and a wide variety of culture. Overall, it's upto the stakeholders to decide which experience they would prefer more and which would more to their liking.\n\nLink to Notebook: https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/f613a2de-1196-40ab-b942-9d85cbf84d33/view?access_token=09275901cc8697ef866a40111cc7809b356fb3421d3b3dec85978697a4d4e175"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
