Introduction\n\nEuropean Countries are quite famous and popular vacation destinations for people all around the world. London, the city of dreams and Paris, the city of love are quite the famous places. They are diverse and multicultural and offer a wide variety of experiences that is widely sought after. We try to group the neighbourhoods of London and Paris respectively and draw insights to what they look like.\n\n\n# 2. Business Problem\n\nThe aim of the project is to help tourists choose their destinations depending on the experiences that the neighbourhoods have to offer and what they would want to have. This also helps people make decisions if they are thinking about migrating to London or Paris or even if they want to relocate neighbourhoods within the city. Relocating requires intensive research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. Our findings will help stakeholders make informed decisions and address any concerns they have including the different kinds of cuisines, provision stores and what the city has to offer. It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for vacation, their work or to start a new fresh life.\n\n\n# 3. Data\n\nWe get geolocation data for London and Paris. Using Postal codes in each city we use can find out the neighbourhoods, boroughs, venues and their most popular venue categories. For London, we will scrape our data from a Wikipedia page. For Paris, we will import the dataset available online.\n\n\n## 3.1. Foursquare API\n\nWe will need data about different venues in different neighbourhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\nWe cluster the neighbourhoods together based on similar venue categories. We then present our observations and findings. Using this data, our stakeholders can take the necessary decision.\n\n## 3.2. ArcGis API\n\nWe use ArcGIS to get the geo locations of the neighbourhoods of London.\n\n## 3.3. Paris\nTo derive our solution, We leverage JSON data available at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/e88c6fda-1d09-42a0-a069-606d3259114e\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
